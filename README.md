# XenForo-Prevent-Hiding-Members
PHM was designed to prevent members from shutting the world off by permission restricting the `followed` `allow_view_profile` option under privacy settings. This add-on is especially useful for marketplaces and forums which generally requires member feedback trust.

## Options
This add-on does not have any options packed within.

## Permissions
